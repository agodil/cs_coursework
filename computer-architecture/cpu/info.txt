4 bit MIPS CPU that implements the given instruction set. Includes control unit, ALU, and program counter.
Instructions are 16 bits and in the form "opcode dest_reg reg_a reg_b" or "opcode dest_reg reg_a immediate"
All intruction components are four bits wide.
Grader circuit was given beforehand for testing.
